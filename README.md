## Acknowledgments

Though it does not share any meaningful source code with them, this project is
heavily inspired by the excellent
[macdeploystick](https://bitbucket.org/twocanoes/macdeploystick/src/master/) and
[pycreateuserpkg](https://github.com/gregneagle/pycreateuserpkg) projects.
(They're also great programs for more general solutions outside the scope of
`mkmacvm`, and they actually work.) Please see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for further
acknowledgment of their contributions.
